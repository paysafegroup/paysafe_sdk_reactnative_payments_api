                               TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   These SDK License Terms and Conditions (this “Agreement”) is between Paysafe Holding UK Limited,
   company number 03202517, whose registered office is at 2 Gresham Street, 1st Floor, London, England,
   EC2V 7AD, United Kingdom(“Paysafe”) and the person or entity accessing, installing, or using the SDK(“You” and “Your”).

   1. INTRODUCTION.
   1.1 Paysafe provides certain financial services including online payment
       processing, digital wallets, and ecommerce and cryptocurrency solutions(collectively, the “Services”).
       Paysafe has defined certain programming interfaces for use by You in developing applications that interact with
       the Services (as further described at <https://developer.paysafe.com/en/api-docs/embedded-wallets/overview/>,
       the “API”). This Agreement establishes the terms under which Paysafe
       will provide You with a limited license to access the API and certain
       related documentation, libraries, tools, tests, files, code, and other
       supporting materials made available by Paysafe in connection with the
       API (collectively, the “SDK”).
   1.2 BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SERVICES,
       API, OR SDK (COLLECTIVELY, THE “PLATFORM”) YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS
       AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT,
       DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, OR OTHERWISE USE THE PLATFORM.
   1.3 This Agreement applies to any SDK that includes, displays, or links to
       this Agreement, and to any updates, supplements, or support services for
       the SDK.
   1.4 Paysafe may change this Agreement by giving You reasonable advance
       notice before the change is in force. If You do not agree to any such
       change, then You must stop using the Platform before any such change
       take effect. If You do not stop using the Platform prior to any such
       change taking effect, then Your use of the Platform will continue under
       the changed Agreement.
   1.5 This Agreement supersedes and takes precedence over any prior agreement
       or proposal, oral or written, and any other communications between You
       and Paysafe relating to the Platform.

   2. TERM.
   This Agreement is effective until terminated.

   3. LIMITED LICENSE.
   During the term of this Agreement, and provided that You remain in
   compliance with this Agreement, Paysafe hereby grants You a limited,
   non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to
   access and use the SDK solely to: (1) develop software applications solely
   limited to the field of use of video games on personal computers and mobile
   applications, where the software applications are developed by You, are
   owned and controlled by You, and are intended for operation with the
   Services (the “Applications”); (2) enable the Applications to interface
   directly with the Services through the APIs as intended by Paysafe; (3)
   distribute the Applications to end-user customers residing solely within the
   country in which You reside (“End Users”); and (4) allow End Users of the
   Applications to access the Services through the Applications as made
   available to You by Paysafe through the SDK. Unless otherwise agreed in
   writing by the parties, the Applications that You may develop using the
   license hereunder are strictly limited to consumer-facing End User
   interactions with the Services, and under no circumstances may any
   Applications be for Your own server-side or back-office use. Notwithstanding
   anything to the contrary in this Agreement, You shall not develop or
   otherwise use any Applications for the purpose of dealing in spyware, adware
   or other malicious programs or code, counterfeit goods, items subject to
   United States embargo, unsolicited mass distribution of email, multi-level
   marketing proposals, emergency or life-saving services, or any libelous,
   defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or hateful speech or content.
   Except as expressly stated in this Section, Paysafe grants You no rights or
   licenses in or to the Platform, whether by implication, estoppel, or
   otherwise.

   4. RESTRICTIONS.
   All access to and use of the Platform by You must be solely as expressly
   permitted herein. You acknowledges that the Platform and the software,
   hardware, data, databases, and other technology comprising the Platform
   (collectively, the “Technology”), constitute the valuable IPR (as defined
   below) of Paysafe. As an express condition to the rights granted to You
   under this Agreement, You will not and will not permit any End User or third
   party to: (1) use or access the Technology or any portion thereof for any
   purpose except as expressly provided in this Agreement; (2) modify, adapt,
   alter, translate, or create derivative works from the Technology; (3)
   distribute, resell, lend, loan, lease, license, sublicense, transfer, or
   make available the Technology, or any rights in or to the Technology to any third party,
   including any of Your affiliates. Redistribution by third parties, including forking, wrapping,
   or bundling the SDK in other packages, is not permitted.; (4) access or use the
   Technology in any unlawful, illegal, or unauthorized manner; (5) in the sole
   opinion of Paysafe, access or use the SDK (or any other part of the
   Technology) in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair
   the Services or the servers, networks, or services of any third party,
   including, without limitation, any such damages, disabling, overburdening,
   or impairment caused by excessive messaging, denial of services attacks,
   spoofing, traffic redirection, or unauthorized computer or network
   monitoring; (6) except as permitted by applicable law or any open source
   license governing any component of the SDK, reverse engineer, decompile,
   disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, structure,
   design, or method of operation for the Technology, including any reverse
   engineering of any binary code contained in the SDK; (7) circumvent or
   overcome (or attempt to circumvent or overcome) any technological protection
   measures intended to restrict access to the Technology; (8) interfere in any
   manner with the operation of the Technology or attempt to gain unauthorized
   access to the Technology; (9) use the SDK (or any other part of the
   Technology) to access or interface with any products, systems, applications,
   software, or hardware other than the Services; (10) develop any software or
   other technology for accessing or using the Services in a way other than
   through the SDK; (11) use automated scripts or processes to collect
   information from or otherwise interact with the Technology; (12) use any
   part of the Technology to develop, or facilitate a third party to develop, a
   product or service that is competitive to the Services or the Technology; or
   (13) alter, obscure, or remove any copyright notice, copyright management
   information, or proprietary legend contained in or on any Technology. All
   use of the Technology will be in accordance with any applicable
   documentation provided by Paysafe. Additionally, You shall (a) not permit
   any API calls or any tokens used to make API calls, each of which interact
   with the Platform, to be generated from, stored in, or used in connection
   with any network or system that is not fully under Your control; and (b)
   ensure that any tokens or other technologies used to make API calls to the
   Platform are not incorporated or made part of any Application in any way.

   5. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to this Agreement, you may be required to enter into certain
   additional agreements with either Paysafe or other third parties before
   being given access to elements of the SDK (each, an “Additional Agreement”).
   In the event of a conflict between any Additional Agreement and this
   Agreement, the Additional Agreement will control with respect to your access
   to and use of those elements of the SDK to which the Additional Agreement
   applies, and this Agreement will control in all other respects.

   6. EULA.
   Prior to allowing any End User to use any Application, or to access the
   Services through any Application, You will ensure that each End User has
   entered into an end user license agreement applicable to the Application (a
   “EULA”). Each EULA will contain terms at least as protective of Paysafe and
   the Technology as the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
   foregoing, Paysafe reserves the right to review and approve each EULA prior
   to distribution of any Application. You will provide Paysafe with such
   information and assistance as may be required to verify that each End User
   has agreed to be legally bound by and remains in compliance with the EULA.
   You will remain solely responsible for all use of the Services by each End
   User and for each End User’s compliance or failure to comply with the EULA.
   You will immediately notify Paysafe upon becoming aware of any breach of any
   EULA by an End User and will fully enforce the terms of each applicable EULA
   against each End User in the case of any breach thereof. You will ensure
   that all information about each End User provided to Paysafe is and remains
   accurate and complete and that the provision thereof complies with all
   applicable laws, including data privacy laws. You will prevent unauthorized
   access to or use of the Services through any Application. You will notify
   Paysafe immediately of any such unauthorized access or use of the Services.

   7. TESTING.
   You will develop each Application strictly in compliance with the terms of
   this Agreement, the SDK (including any documentation), and any additional
   instructions provided by Paysafe and will remain solely responsible for
   ensuring that You, Your employees’ and Your agents’, and any End Users’
   operation of each Application remains in compliance with the terms of this
   Agreement, the SDK (including any documentation), and any such additional
   instructions. Prior to distributing or making any Application available for
   release to End Users (whether commercially or for evaluation purposes), You
   will self-test the Application to ensure that it operates properly with the
   Services through the SDK and complies with all applicable test suites for
   the Platform established by Paysafe (“Tests”). Following successful
   completion of such self-testing, You will submit a copy of each Application
   to Paysafe for review and testing by Paysafe. You hereby grant Paysafe all
   rights necessary for Paysafe to review and test each Application for
   compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all
   applicable Tests. You will not provide access to or use of an Application to
   any End User prior to confirmation by Paysafe that such Application has
   successfully completed such Tests. Notwithstanding successful completion of
   any Tests, Paysafe may, in its sole discretion, require You to cease
   distribution and operation of any Application if Paysafe, in its sole
   discretion, reasonably believes that the Application fails to comply with
   the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any applicable Tests.

   8. DATA.
   8.1 Your Data.
       You are solely responsible for all data, information, and other content
       (“Data”) provided to Paysafe through the SDK by or on behalf of You or
       any End User, whether via the Application or the Services (“Your Data”).
       As between You and Paysafe, You retain all of Your rights in and to Your
       Data. You hereby grant to Paysafe all rights and licenses in and to Your
       Data necessary for Paysafe to provide access to the Platform under this
       Agreement and to otherwise perform its obligations and exercise its
       rights under this Agreement. You represent and warrant to Paysafe that
       You have all right, title, and interest in, and have obtained all
       consents and permissions to, all Your Data necessary to grant Paysafe
       the foregoing rights and licenses (including as required by all
       applicable data privacy laws), and You agree to maintain such rights
       throughout this Agreement. Paysafe will not be responsible or liable
       for any deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss, or failure with
       respect to any of Your Data. Paysafe may take remedial action if any of
       Your Data violates this Agreement, provided that Paysafe is under no
       obligation to review any of Your Data for potential liability.

   8.2 Platform Data.
       Any Data provided or made available to You or any End User through the
       Platform (“Platform Data”), excluding only Your Data, is owned by
       Paysafe and Paysafe’s data providers. You are solely responsible for
       obtaining consents from Paysafe’s data providers, in a form provided by
       or acceptable to Paysafe, allowing You and Your End Users to use the
       Platform Data (“Consents”). You covenant and agree to use any Platform
       Data solely within the scope of such Consents. Paysafe reserves the
       right to limit or suspend access by You to any portion of any Platform
       Data if Paysafe cannot reasonably verify that You have obtained all such
       Consents. All Platform Data is provided to You solely for informational
       purposes. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy,
       completeness, and applicability of all Platform Data before using or
       relying rely upon any Platform Data. Notwithstanding any Consent, You
       will not, and will not permit any third party to: (a) alter, modify,
       reproduce, or create derivative works of any Platform Data; (b)
       distribute, sell, resell, lend, loan, lease, license, sublicense, or
       transfer any Platform Data; or (c) alter, obscure, or remove any
       copyright, trademark, or any other notices that are provided on or in
       connection with any Platform Data. Except as set forth in this
       Agreement, You are granted no licenses or rights in or to any Platform
       Data.

   9. MODIFICATIONS.
   Paysafe reserves the right to modify or release new versions of the SDK at
   any time by providing notice of the modifications or new versions to You.
   Upon such notice, You will obtain and use the most current version of the
   SDK within the time period stated by Paysafe. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH
   ANY ASPECT OF THE MODIFICATIONS OR NEW RELEASE VERSIONS OF THE SDK AT ANY
   TIME, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO CEASE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF
   THE PLATFORM.

   10. SUPPORT.
   You are solely responsible for all support and maintenance relating to each
   Application, whether requested or required by You or any End Users. Unless
   Paysafe and You have entered into a separate support agreement, Paysafe is
   under no obligation to provide You or any End User with any support relating
   to the Platform, provided that Paysafe may provide support to You or
   directly to any End User if deemed necessary or appropriate by Paysafe.

   11. COMPENSATION.
   Access to or use of certain elements of the SDK may require payment of fees,
   as specified in an Additional Agreement. Any such fees will be subject to
   the terms of this Agreement and any such other Additional Agreements. You
   are responsible for all payment of any applicable taxes, fees, value-added
   surcharges, import and export duties, and other assessments or duties levied
   or assessed against You or Paysafe by any governmental entity in connection
   with Your use of or access to the Platform, including any use of the
   Applications.

   12. OWNERSHIP.
   Paysafe retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Technology; any
   updates, upgrades, enhancements, modifications, new versions, and
   improvements thereto, created by either party, either alone or with the
   other party or any third party (“Improvements”); and all intellectual
   property and proprietary rights therein or relating thereto throughout the
   world, including all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents (and
   patent applications), moral rights, rights in data and databases, and other
   intellectual property and proprietary rights, whether created before, on, or
   after the start of the term of this Agreement (“IPR”). As between You and
   Paysafe, You will maintain ownership of Your Applications, provided that You
   receive no ownership interest in or to any of the Technology, and no rights
   or licenses are granted to You to access or use any of the Technology,
   except for the rights expressly granted to You under this Agreement,
   regardless of whether any portions of the SDK or other portions of the
   Platform are used in or in connection with any Application. You agree to,
   and hereby do, assign to Paysafe any and all right, title, or interest in or
   to any Improvements, and all IPR therein or relating thereto, that may be
   acquired by You at any time. The Technology may include third-party
   software offered under an open source license or third-party content subject
   to a separate third-party agreement. To the extent any of such third-party
   terms conflict with this Agreement, such third-party terms will control
   solely with respect to such third-party software or content. If You provide
   comments, suggestions, recommendations, ideas, know-how, or other feedback
   about the Technology, Paysafe may use such information for any purposes
   without obligation to You, and all IPR in any such feedback are deemed (and
   hereby) licensed to Paysafe (with the right to sublicense through multiple
   tiers) for any purpose on a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully
   paid-up, sublicensable, transferrable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free basis
   and may be used or disclosed for any purpose. The names and logos of
   Paysafe and those of its affiliates, providers, and licensors are trademarks
   of Paysafe or such affiliates, providers, or licensors, as applicable, and
   no right or license is granted to You to use them.

   13. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION.
   Paysafe has the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if You fail to
   comply with any term of this Agreement. Additionally, Paysafe may, in its
   sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the SDK at any time. Upon
   any termination or expiration of this Agreement: (1) all rights granted to
   You hereunder will immediately terminate; (2) Paysafe may cease providing
   access to the Platform to You; and (3) You will cease all use of the
   Platform and all Applications making use of the Platform and destroy all
   copies of the SDK and any Confidential Information in Your possession or
   control. Upon the request of Paysafe, You will certify in writing to Your
   compliance with the terms of this Section. Any provision which by its
   inherent meaning is to survive termination or expiration of this Agreement
   will so survive.

   14. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
   You represent, warrant, and covenant to Paysafe that: (1) You will maintain
   all rights, power, and authority necessary to enter into this Agreement and
   perform all of Your obligations under this Agreement; (2) Your use of the
   Platform will not violate, and will not cause Paysafe to violate, any
   federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations or the rights of any
   third party; and (3) except as set forth herein, You will obtain all rights,
   licenses, permits, and other approvals required for Your use of the Platform
   and Your performance under this Agreement.

   15. DISCLAIMER.
   THE TECHNOLOGY IS PROVIDED BY PAYSAFE AND ITS LICENSORS AND PROVIDERS ON AN
   “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
   OR COVENANTS OF ANY KIND. PAYSAFE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, AND YOU DISCLAIM ANY
   RELIANCE ON, ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS, WHETHER
   EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING
   ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR
   ADVICE GIVEN BY PAYSAFE OR ITS AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES WILL CREATE ANY
   REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS UNLESS CONFIRMED IN WRITING BY
   PAYSAFE AS AN AMENDMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

   16. INDEMNITY.
   You will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Paysafe (and its officers,
   directors, shareholders, employees, contractors, agents, successors, and
   assigns) from and against any claims, suits, demands, and actions and all
   resulting damages, liabilities, losses, judgments, settlements, penalties,
   fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (each, a
   “Claim”) incurred in connection with or as a result of: (1) Your use of or
   access to the Technology, including any data, information, content, or
   results generated through the Platform; (2) any of Your Data, Applications,
   or any access thereto or use thereof; (3) Your breach of any provision of
   this Agreement; or (4) damage to property or injury to or death of any
   person directly or indirectly caused by You or any of Your employees or
   agents. Paysafe may participate in the defense of any Claim, and You will
   not settle any Claim without the prior written consent of Paysafe.

   17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   IN NO EVENT WILL PAYSAFE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY
   SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES
   OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR THIS AGREEMENT,
   INCLUDING ANY LOST, CORRUPTED, OR ALTERED DATA OR INFORMATION; LOSS OF USE
   OF DATA OR INFORMATION; RECOVERY OF DATA OR INFORMATION; OR LOSS OR
   INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR REVENUE, EVEN IF PAYSAFE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LOSSES OR
   DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF ONE OR MORE OTHER REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR
   ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE MAXIMUM CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF PAYSAFE RELATING TO
   THE TECHNOLOGY OR THIS AGREEMENT WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE
   GREATER OF THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO PAYSAFE BY YOU UNDER THIS
   AGREEMENT OR $10.00 USD. IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES IS NOT PERMITTED, PAYSAFE’S LIABILITY IS
   LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

   18. CONFIDENTIALITY.
   For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means the
   Technology, Platform Data, and all other documentation, information, data,
   and materials provided by or obtained from Paysafe, regardless of the form
   thereof, including all copies thereof. You will use the Confidential
   Information only if expressly permitted to do so by Paysafe herein and, if
   not permitted to do so, will not use such Confidential Information. You may
   disclose the Confidential Information only to those of Your employees who
   have a need to know the Confidential Information for purposes of the use
   thereof and who are bound by a written legal obligation of confidentiality
   at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms of this
   Agreement. You will not otherwise disclose the Confidential Information
   without Paysafe’s prior written consent. You will treat all Confidential
   Information with the same degree of care as You treat Your own confidential
   information which, in no event, will be less than reasonable care.

   19. DATA PRIVACY.
   Paysafe may collect, use, and share Data in connection with the operation
   and use of the Technology in accordance with the terms of the Paysafe
   Privacy Policy available at
   <https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/paysafegroup/comprehensive-privacy-notice/>
   (the “Privacy Policy”). Paysafe may update the Privacy Policy from time to
   time, and Your continued exercise of the license rights granted to You under
   this Agreement shall be deemed Your acceptance of any such updates.

   20. DISPUTES.
   The parties will attempt to resolve any disputes, controversies, or claims
   arising under, out of, or relating to this Agreement (“Disputes”) via good
   faith negotiations between each party, involving such levels of management
   as are required to resolve such Dispute. Any Dispute that cannot be
   resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties will be settled
   exclusively through binding arbitration as follows. If within 10 business
   days, or 5 business days in the event of a Dispute related to IPR, the
   parties are unable to resolve any Dispute, either party may submit the
   Dispute for final settlement through binding arbitration by the
   International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) under its arbitration rules then
   in effect (the “Rules”). Either party may commence the arbitration by
   delivering a request for arbitration as specified in the Rules. The
   arbitration will be conducted before a sole neutral arbitrator selected by
   agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree on the appointment of
   a single arbitrator within 30 days (the “Initial Period”) after either party
   to this Agreement delivers a request for arbitration, a neutral arbitrator
   will be selected as provided in the Rules. The seat of the arbitration
   shall be the United States of America, and the arbitration will be conducted
   in the English language in Duval County, Florida (USA) or such other
   location as may be designated by Paysafe. The award of the arbitrator(s)
   will be the exclusive remedy of the parties for all claims, counterclaims,
   issues, or accountings presented or plead to the arbitrator. The award of
   the arbitrator will require payment of the costs, fees, and expenses
   incurred by the prevailing party in any such arbitration by the
   non-prevailing party. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court
   or governmental body having jurisdiction thereof. Any additional costs,
   fees, or expenses incurred in enforcing the award may be charged against the
   party that resists its enforcement. Notwithstanding the terms of this
   Section, nothing in this Agreement will limit either party’s right to seek
   immediate injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent
   jurisdiction in the event of any actual, suspected, or anticipated breach of
   this Agreement or any IPR of either party.

   21. NOTICES.
   Paysafe may give notices to You, at Paysafe’s option, by posting on any
   portion of the Paysafe Developer Website <https://developer.paysafe.com/>,
   or by electronic mail to any email address provided by You to Paysafe. You
   may give notices to Paysafe at 5335 Gate Parkway, Fourth Floor,
   Jacksonville, Florida 32256, USA, Attn: Legal Department. Notices given by
   You under this Agreement will be via reputable personal delivery or
   overnight courier service. Notices by Paysafe will be effective upon
   delivery, and notices by You will be effective upon receipt by Paysafe.
   Either party may change its address for notice by giving notice of the new
   address to the other party.

   22. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.
   This Agreement will be governed by the Laws of the State of Florida (USA),
   without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof. Subject to the
   arbitration provisions of this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree
   that the federal and state courts located in Duval County, Florida (USA)
   will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising
   hereunder. The parties irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of
   such courts.

   23. ASSIGNMENT.
   You may not assign, transfer or delegate, in whole or in part, whether by
   assignment, sale, merger, reorganization, operation of law, or otherwise,
   this Agreement or any of Your rights or obligations under this Agreement, to
   any third party without the prior written consent of Paysafe. For the
   purposes of this Agreement, any change of control of You will be deemed an
   assignment. Paysafe may assign this Agreement with or without notice to
   You. Any assignment in violation of any of the foregoing in this Section 23
   will be null and void and will be considered a breach of this Agreement.

   24. NON-ENDORSEMENT.
   It is expressly agreed and understood by the parties that this Agreement
   does not constitute an endorsement by Paysafe of You, nor the products,
   actions, behavior, or conduct of You, and any misrepresentation by You to
   the contrary, in any context and in any forum, will constitute a material
   breach of this Agreement, and the same will be grounds for immediate
   termination of this Agreement by Paysafe, notwithstanding any provision to
   the contrary in Section 13 above. In the event of any such
   misrepresentation, Paysafe may require You to publicly acknowledge the
   misrepresentation in a like forum in which the misrepresentation was made

   25. GENERAL.
   This Agreement supersedes all oral or written agreements or understandings
   between the parties as to the subject matter of the Agreement other than any Additional Agreement
   You may enter into regarding the Platform. This Agreement is in the English language, which language
   will be controlling in all respects. The waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement
   will not operate or be interpreted as a waiver of any other or subsequent
   breach. In no event will Paysafe be liable for any responsibilities or
   obligations of You hereunder (or any failure by You to fulfill such
   obligations). If any provision of this Agreement is held by an arbitrator
   or a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision
   will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such
   provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the
   remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and
   effect. Paysafe will not be held responsible for failure or delay in the
   performance of any obligation under this Agreement if such failure or delay
   is beyond its reasonable control. The parties are independent contractors,
   and nothing in this Agreement will be construed as creating an
   employer-employee relationship, a partnership, or a joint venture between
   the parties. Neither party is an agent of the other, and neither party is
   authorized to make any representation, contract, or commitment on behalf of
   the other party. Except for any permitted indemnitees, no term of this
   Agreement will be construed to confer any third-party beneficiary rights on
   any non-party. Each and every right and remedy hereunder is cumulative with
   each and every other right and remedy herein or in any other agreement
   between the parties or under applicable law. The Technology is subject to
   U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations
   in other countries. You agree to strictly comply with all such laws and
   acknowledge that You have the responsibility to obtain such licenses to
   export, re-export, or import as may be required. The words “include,”
   “includes,” and “including” mean “include,” “includes,” or “including,” in
   each case, “without limitation.”  The parties expressly waive any
   applications of the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
   of Goods with respect to the performance or interpretations of this
   Agreement.
